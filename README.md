# Word-Puzzle

 This is a Python program that searches a grid of letters (a-z only) for valid English words much more quickly than any human possibly could. Words can be found along any diagonal, forwards, upwards, downwards or backwards and must not ‘wrap’ between edges
 
 # Steps to run the program
 From terminal, run the following command:
 
 python word_search.py -r [row_size] -c [column_size] -f [filepath]
 
 The code takes 3 inputs:
 
 r - number of rows in the puzzle grid
 
 c - number of columns in the puzzle grid
 
 f - the input file containing the words
